### RL and RLC
The RuleBook Compiler (`RLC`) is an MLIR-based compiler for a domain-specific language aimed at simplifying the complexity of developing multiagent simulations at all stages of development.

The elevator pitch description of the `RL` is:
> **A language that turns a easy-to-write procedural description of a simulation into a easy-to-use and easy-to-reuse efficient library**.

Read the language rationale [here](./docs/rationale.md)
Read how we analyzed a off the shelf game [here](./docs/space_hulk_level_design.md)
Read a tutorial explaining how to play black jack [here](./docs/tutorial.md)

At the moment `RLC` is a proof of concept, and is released to gather feedback on the features of the language. Until version 1.0 syntax and semantics may change at any point.

Before version 1.0 we want for users to be able to produce:
* a compiled library implementing such simulation (DONE)
* a serialization and deserialization mechanism both in textual and binary format (DONE)
* a fuzzer able to find bugs in the simulation (DONE)
* machine learning algorithms able to analyze the simulation. (development started)
* a simple network protocol able to run the simulation remotely (not yet started)

### Example: tic tac toe
```

# declares the equivalent of a struct called Board.
# It contains the tic tac toe slots and the current player turn
# Methods omitted for brevity
cls Board:
	Int[9] slots
	Bool playerTurn

act play() -> TicTacToe:
	# allocates and initializes a board of type Board
	let board : Board
	while !full(board):

		# declares a suspension point of the simulation,
		# an action called mark that requires two ints to be performed.
		act mark(Int x, Int y) {
		# declares contraints about which inputs are valid
			x < 3,
			x >= 0,
			y < 3,
			y >= 0,
			board.get(x, y) == 0
		}

		# marks the board at the position provided
		board.set(x, y)

		# if the current player has three marks in a line
		# return
		if board.three_in_a_line():
			return

		board.change_current_player()


fun main() -> Int:
	# creates a new game
	let game = play()
	game.mark(0, 0)
	# X _ _
	# _ _ _
	# _ _ _
	game.mark(1, 0)
	# X O _
	# _ _ _
	# _ _ _
	game.mark(1, 1)
	# X O _
	# _ X _
	# _ _ _
	game.mark(2, 0)
	# X O O
	# _ X _
	# _ _ _
	game.mark(2, 2)
	# X O O
	# _ X _
	# _ _ X

	# returns 1 because player 1 indeed
	# had three marks in a line
	return int(game.board.three_in_a_line())
```

### Try it!

At the moment we provide binaries only for linux x64 and windows x64.

```
pip install rl_language
```

Language reference and stdlib documentation [here](https://github.com/rl-language/rlc-stdlib-doc/tree/master).

### Dependencies
Base:
* cpp17 compiler
* python
* CMake

Extra dependecies used by the setup script:
* Bash
* Ninja
* virtualenv
* lld

### License

We wish for `RLC` to be usable by all as a compiler, for both commercial and non-commercial purposes, so it is released under apache license.


### Installation for developers

We provide a setup script that downloads the rlc repository and a setup script that will download and compile `LLVM` as well as `RLC`. As long as the dependencies written before are met you should just be able to run the following commands and everything should work. Installing and building llvm debug will take ~100 gigabytes of hard drive space and will require a large amount of time and RAM. This is only required when building from sources, pypi packages are much less than 1gb on each operating system.

Hard drive space can be reclaimed by deleting `LLVM` build directory after it has been fully built.

Download the setup.sh file in the root of the repository and then run:
```
chmod +x setup.sh
source ./setup.sh # clones RLC repo and initialize virtualenvs and submodules
python rlc/build.py # clones LLVM, builds it and builds RLC
```

on mac and windows replace the last line with
```
python rlc/build.py --no-use-lld
```

If that script terminates successfully, you are fully set up to start working on `RLC`.

#### What do if run out of space or memory
Instead of the previous command python, you can run. This will only build the release LLVM version and save a great deal of space.
```
python rlc/build.py --no-debug-llvm
```

#### Using a custom LLVM
```
python rlc/build.py --llvm-dir <PATH-TO-LLVM-INSTALL> [--rlc-shared]
```

You need to use the flag --rlc-shared if you have built a shared LLVM.

### environment.sh
If you are using the default installation script (setup.sh) we provide a .sh file that configures your environment variable so that you can use python and rlc without installing anything in your actual machine.
When you open a shell to start working on RLC run the following command.

If you use some editor such as code or clion, start it from that shell.

```
source environment.sh
```

To check if everything works correctly run the following command.
```
python python/solve.py ./tool/rlc/test/tic_tac_toe.rl
```
If it does not crashes, then you are good to go.

If you use some whacky shell of your own or you did not followed the default setup, you are on your own.

### How to contribute for developers
* fork this project.
* push your branches to your fork
* open a pull request for the branch relevant to your project

The intent of this workflow is so that reviewrs can use the review feature of github pull requests to have persistent comment threads.

### Roadmap

#### machine learning
* update to newer ray that does not leak [Blocked by them]
* update and pin to the newer ray that works on windows and does not have trivial issues [Blocked by them]
* figure out how to make transformers fast [Blocked by them]
* figure out how to not duplicate the state at every action and thus allow true self play [Blocked by them]

#### language
* better debug support
* inline initializers

#### standard lib
* graph library
* dictionary library

#### for 1.0
* windows support, blocked by ray
